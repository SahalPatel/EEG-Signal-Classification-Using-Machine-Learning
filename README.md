# EEG-Signal-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project presents a clean and simple workflow for analyzing EEG data and generating topographic brain maps using MNE-Python. The notebook demonstrates how to load PSD (Power Spectral Density) values, map them to electrode positions, and visualize the distribution of different EEG frequency bands across the scalp.
